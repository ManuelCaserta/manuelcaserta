👋 I’m Manuel Caserta

Automation & AI Engineer | AI Agents + CRM/Workflow Systems (production-ready)

I build operational systems that remove manual work across Sales, Support, and Operations.

Most of my work lives inside real workflows:
intake that drops leads, CRMs full of duplicates, follow-ups that don’t happen, handoffs that break, and “AI assistants” that hallucinate instead of executing.

This GitHub is where I share the templates, patterns, and starter stacks I use to ship reliable systems fast.

⚙️ What I build (in production)
AI Agents (with guardrails)

intake, qualification, booking, support

RAG connected to real company knowledge (PDFs, Notion, docs)

logging, traceability, and human handoff

“execute work”, not “chat”

CRM & workflow automation

lead capture → CRM → routing → tasks → follow-up

deduplication, required fields, pipeline hygiene

error handling, retries, alerts (no silent failures)

integrations via APIs/webhooks

Operational reporting

KPI pipelines that teams can trust

clean metric definitions + single source of truth

dashboards built for decisions, not decoration

🧱 Building blocks you’ll find here

These repos exist because I rebuild the same operational scaffolding across projects.

Agentic RAG / Knowledge

RAG templates: chunking, retrieval, reranking patterns

doc + data Q&A (PDF + structured data)
(planned / WIP)

Automation patterns

n8n workflow templates

retries, idempotency, structured logging

webhook handling patterns
(planned / WIP)

CRM utilities

data hygiene helpers (dedupe, enrichment, normalization)

routing rules + workflow orchestration patterns
(planned / WIP)

Infrastructure & tooling (legacy but useful)

CI templates, TS tooling, dev stacks

kept public for reuse

🔬 What I’m working on now

production templates for AI Agents (intake → CRM → action)

RAG for PDFs + spreadsheets (real analysis, not “chat over text”)

n8n patterns for reliable automations (alerts, retries, audit logs)

a clean “Operational Audit” checklist for Sales & Ops systems
