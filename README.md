# 👋 I'm Manuel Caserta  
**System Fixer for small B2B SaaS & micro-agencies (48–72h blocks)**  
I fix Stripe billing, stabilise automations, and build 1-page KPI dashboards.

Most of my work happens inside real systems:  
billing that leaks money, webhooks that create zombie states, Zapier/n8n flows that silently die, dashboards nobody trusts.

This GitHub is where I share the tooling, templates and starter stacks I use to build and stabilise those systems quickly.

---

## 🔧 What I actually fix (in production)

### **Stripe sanity**
- dunning, retries, CAU  
- broken upgrade/downgrade flows  
- subscription state mismatches  
- involuntary churn disguised as “Stripe issues”

### **Operational automations**
- Zapier / n8n / custom API workers  
- lead → CRM → email → task flows  
- error handling (4xx vs 5xx), retries, logging, alerts  
- eliminating silent failures that cost MRR or leads

### **1-page KPI dashboards**
- revenue, ops, sales/marketing, capacity  
- strict metric definitions  
- single source of truth across tools  
- built for small teams who need decisions, not wallpapers

I do all of this in **48–72h fixed-scope blocks**, not open-ended projects.

## 🧰 Open tooling I use across projects

These repos exist because I rebuild a lot of the same operational scaffolding for clients.

### **Stripe / Billing**
- starter workers for webhook → fetch-latest-state patterns  
- demo implementations of reliable dunning + retries  
*(coming soon)*

### **Automation & workflow utilities**
- error-handling templates for Zapier/n8n  
- structured logging + retry logic patterns  
*(coming soon)*

### **Dashboards & reporting**
- 1-page KPI layouts  
- standardised metric definitions (MRR, churn, capacity)  
*(coming soon)*

### **JavaScript / TypeScript tooling (legacy but still useful)**
These come from my old “tooling builder” positioning. Keeping them public for devs who need them:
- ESLint + Prettier Pack  
- TSConfig Pack for modular apps  
- GitHub Actions CI templates  
- Docker dev stacks

---

## 📡 What I’m currently working on
- more Stripe sanity templates (dunning + retries + CAU)  
- stable webhook workers for small SaaS stacks  
- deterministic lead → CRM → email flows for micro-agencies  
- a clean, repeatable 1-page KPI dashboard system

If you're running a small SaaS or agency and need your billing, automations or KPIs to stop lying to you, this is the work I do.
