# 👋 Hey, I'm Manuel Caserta

**Freelance full-stack developer** — I build plug-and-play tooling and starter stacks for JavaScript / TypeScript developers.  

💡 My goal: help you start production-ready projects in minutes — not hours.

### 🚀 Free & Open-Source Tooling
- 🔧 **ESLint + Prettier Pack (Free)**  
  Opinionated setup for consistent code style. Zero bikeshedding.  

- 🧩 **TSConfig Pack (Free)**  
  Modular TypeScript configs that scale from single apps to monorepos.  

- ⚙️ **GitHub Actions CI Template (Freemium)**  
  Ready-to-use workflows for linting, testing, and building on every push.

- 🐳 **Docker Dev Stack (free)** – Node.js + PostgreSQL + Redis stack for full local development setups.  

---

### 🧰 Dev Environments (Pro – coming soon)
- 🗄️ **DB Sandbox** – preconfigured PostgreSQL + Adminer environment for local testing and prototyping.
